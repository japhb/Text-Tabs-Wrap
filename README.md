# Text-Tabs-Wrap

Text-Tabs-Wrap is a port of the Perl 5 Text-Tabs+Wrap distribution to Perl 6.
The API is slightly different because we have all the Perl 6 bells and whistles,
but the module should behave the same (i.e. the original testcases are still
used, loosely paraphrased into Perl6ish code, and should pass cleanly).

Text::Tabs provides the `expand` and `unexpand` functions, which perform the
same job that the Unix `expand(1)` and `unexpand(1)` commands do: adding or
removing tabs from a document.

Text::Wrap gives you `wrap` and `fill` functions. `wrap` will break up long
lines; it doesn't join short lines together. `fill` reformats entire blocks of
text, similar to vi's `gq` command.

## Current status (2015-05-26)

Requires Rakudo >= `2014.05`. There are a few known test failures marked
TODO, and as of this writing a whole bunch of internal p6 regex errors have
appeared everywhere. I'm not sure what causes those, sorry. You're on your own.

This code is in maintenance mode and not fun to hack on, so if you think you can
do better it might be a good idea to start fresh.

## Installing

Installing via [Panda][gh-panda] is recommended, the package name is
"Text-Tabs-Wrap".

If you prefer to do things manually instead, run the test suite like so:

    prove -e 'perl6 -I lib'

## Credits

This code was originally derived from Perl 5's [Text-Tabs+Wrap][ttr-perl5],
the initial port to Perl 6 was done by [Takadonet][gh-takadonet], and it's been
maintained by [flussence][gh-flussence] since then.
